# **`yay`**

Yet another stack-oriented toy language that transpiles to Go code. Heavily inspired by [Tsoding's Porth YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDailyT).

_**Note:** this is just a simple project to learn about programming languages, transpilers and compilers. Efficiency nor security or mantainabilty are the main intention in this project._

## Features

- **`Dead simple`**
- **`Stack oriented`**
- **`Reverse polish notation`**
- **`Transpiles to Go code -> Can be compiled for a lot of platforms!`**
- **`Highly customizable -> Even the keywords can be localized`**

TODO: Explain that this language is not intended for coroutines so its not concurrency safe (Although it could be easily converted to that if asked)

## Setup

It, obviously, needs golang to be installed in order to compile the transpiled code.
